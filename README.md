# Encoding-and-Scaling
Task 4: Feature Encoding & Scaling on Adult Income Dataset
📌 Objective
To preprocess the Adult Income Dataset by applying feature encoding and scaling techniques so that the data becomes suitable for machine learning models.

📂 Dataset
Adult Income Dataset
Files used:

adult.data
adult.test
adult.names
🛠 Tools & Libraries
Python
Pandas
NumPy
Scikit-learn
🔍 Steps Performed
Loaded the dataset using Pandas.
Identified categorical and numerical features.
Handled missing values by removing invalid entries.
Applied Label Encoding on the target column.
Applied One-Hot Encoding on nominal categorical features.
Scaled numerical features using StandardScaler.
Saved the processed dataset as adult_preprocessed.csv.
📊 Why Encoding & Scaling?
Encoding converts categorical data into numerical form.
Scaling ensures all numerical features contribute equally to model training.
These steps improve accuracy and performance of ML algorithms.
📁 Output Files
